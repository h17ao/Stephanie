multi-step dialogue:[
role1: Hello! How's your day going?
role2: Hi! Just came back from a run and now relaxing with some jazz music.
role1: Sounds like a perfect day!
role1: I also had a good run today with my dogs.
role2: Nice! What breed are they?
role1: I have two Labradors.
role1: The most loyal companions one could ask for.
role2: I bet they are.
role2: I've always wanted to get a dog but with two kids and work it can be quite hectic.
role1: I understand that completely.
role1: Luckily, as an attorney, I have flexible hours which allows me to spend time with them.
role2: A pediatrician's schedule is not so forgiving unfortunately.
role2: I hope someday though...
role1: Fingers crossed for that day then!
role1: Anyways,I am curious about something else too...
role2: Haha sure go ahead.
role1: Isn’t it scary running while listening to jazz? I mean what if there’s traffic or something dangerous around and you can’t hear it because of the music?.
role2: Haha no worries. I only listen to music when running in the park or on the treadmill at home.

In single-step dialogues, each role sends only one message in a turn. In contrast, multi-step dialogues resemble social media messages, where multiple lines can be sent consecutively before the other role replies, simulating the style of human daily chit-chat, with each message typically being shorter. Next, I will provide a text of a multi-step dialogue involving two characters, role1 and role2, who have different personas. In these dialogues, each line represents sending a message.  Please assess whether each message reply in the multi-step dialogue can be further divided into multiple replies (only split, do not combine or change the order of message replies, and continue to maintain the format of a multi-step dialogue, as shown in the example above), to make the conversation more natural, interesting, engaging, and closer to human interaction. If a message reply becomes less natural, interesting, engaging, or human-like after being split, then abandon the split. Finally, provide a new version of the multi-step dialogue and return only the content of it.
