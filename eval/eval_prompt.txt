The above are six metrics for evaluating dialogues. Next, I will provide four dialogues, including both single-step and multi-step dialogues. Single-step dialogues consist of just an  exchange of single message replies back and forth. In contrast, multi-step dialogues resemble social media messages, simulating the style of human daily chit-chat through multiple continuous message replies. The main difference between dialogue 3 and dialogue 4 is that in dialogue 4, the message replies are further divided into more message replies. Please score the four dialogues on the above six metrics, with scores ranging from 0 to 100(accurate to one point), and only return the scores.
